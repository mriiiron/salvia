A basic Salvia project follows the structure below:

```bash
root
├── posts
|   ├── your_post.md.txt
|   └── your_another_post.md.txt
├── themes
|   ├── theme_folder
|   └── another_theme_folder
├── salvia.blog.json
└── salvia.posts.json
```

#### `posts`

> The folder to store your posts. Using <code>.md.txt</code> extension instead of <code>.md</code> to ensure that the file being correctly intepreted by browser as `text/plain`.
> The file name (e.g. `your_post`) would be used as the post key, which would be referred within [configuration files](#).

#### `themes`

> The folder storing [themes](./post.html?postKey=use_theme). A theme is a collection of CSS stylesheets and other supporting files (e.g. fonts).

#### `salvia.blog.json`

> Stores basic [configuration](#config) data about blog itself. This file must be provided by user.

#### `salvia.posts.json`

> Stores metadata about posts. This file could be either provided by user, or [generated by `salvia-cli`](#).
